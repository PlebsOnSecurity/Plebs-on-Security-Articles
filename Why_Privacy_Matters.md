#Why Privacy Matters

You've heard it before: "I've got nothing to hide." It's the endless response to privacy concerns. The government is illegally collecting and monitoring phone calls? Well, that's fine with me because _I have nothing to hide but the bad guys do._ Like a broken record, we see this claim repeated in newspapers, interviews, speeches, blogs, and even advertising campaigns as the UK did so famously in their Orwellian push for more CCTV - "_If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear._"

For the sake of simplicity, we can break it down into four main areas:
* Collection
* Analysis
* Dissemination
* Action

Each area represents a unique and powerful invasion of privacy. The harms from these violations can manifest not only emotionally or physically, but also in chilling behavior which has profound societal ramifications.
