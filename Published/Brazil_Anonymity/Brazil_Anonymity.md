#Anonymity Unconstitutional in Brazil

[Secret](https://www.secret.ly/), the popular [kinda-sorta-anonymous](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/26/secret-app-cyberbullying-security-hackers) secret sharing app has been [banned in Brazil](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/too-many-secrets-court-ruling-spells-bad-news-anonymous-speech-brazil). The forced removal comes after a court case in which a nude photo was posted with text indicating the pictured girl was HIV+ and highlights the clash between law and modern digital privacy issues.

The case centered around two [constitutional](http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/teams/willr3/const.htm) passages:

* Chapter I, article 5, section IV:
> The expression of thought is free, anonymity being forbidden; and

* Chapter I, article 5, section X: 
>  Intimacy, private life, and the honor and image of persons are inviolable, ensuring the right to compensation for material or moral damages resulting from their violation.

The anonymous nature of Secret poses a problem in that users cannot easily (though there is a method) redress violations of their privacy (beyond the outright ban on anonymous expression of thought). But the case raises larger questions on anonymity, freedom of thought, and chilling speech in Brazil as a whole.

It should be noted here that it's difficult to find extensive Brazilian legal literature in English.

What's particularly interesting about the specific, constitutional limitations on anonymity is Brazil's protection of "the expression of intellectual, artistic, scientific, and communications activities is free, independently of censorship or license" (Chapter I, article 5, section IX) and "access to information is ensured to everyone and the confidentiality of the source shall be safeguarded, whenever necessary to the professional activity" (Chapter I, article 5, section XIV) both of which seem to but up against anonymity.

Online anonymity (or pseudo-anonymity) has been a cornerstone of the internet since the beginning. Usenet boards, forums, IRC and other chatrooms all encouraged the use of pseudonyms (screen names/usernames). The birth of social media and sites like Facebook introduced the era of real name use (which has led to disasters like [Google experienced](www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/07/17/google_plus_finally_ditches_its_ineffective_dangerous_real_name_policy.html)) and a brought about a campaign to end anonymity online. [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/19/its-time-to-end-anonymous-comments-sections/) and [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/08/19/the-war-against-online-trolls/free-speech-does-not-protect-cyberharassment) ran pieces calling for the end of online anonymity in an effort to combat cyberbullying and trolling (the crux of the Secret case). Much like the standard arguments against privacy, these campaigns focused on the bad that can occur when anonymity is allowed. This is a huge disservice and ignores all that a pseudonym can offer.

Anonymous usernames allow people to speak candidly on issues that they might otherwise remain silent on. Websites allow people to discuss taboo subjects like [parenting, trying to conceive](http://www.dcurbanmom.com/jforum/forums/list.page), [relationships](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships), [get suicide help](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch), and much more without fear of revealing their problems, issues, and situations. It allows whistleblowers to speak about important problems without fear of reprisal (apparently covered in Chapter I, article 5, section XIV), allows reporting of domestic, child, or sexual abuse, and countless other invaluable situations.

The value of online anonymity is _huge_ and threatening that discourages all this positive, beneficial behavior. The Pew Research Center [has found](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/26/social-media-and-the-spiral-of-silence/) that people are hesitant to post to Facebook and Twitter due to fear of what other people may think. In fact, they're much more open talking about hot button topics like Snowden and the NSA revelations to complete strangers. This is the cost of the lack of anonymity.

With nations like [Russia enforcing mandatory ID](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/08/us-russia-internet-idUSKBN0G81RV20140808) usage to access public wifi (and other nations hurrying to follow suit) the threat to our online persona is growing. Now, more than ever, we need to let our lawmakers know the value of online anonymity and fight for our online rights.
