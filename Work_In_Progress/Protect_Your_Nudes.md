#Hot to Secure Your Nudes

The web has been awash for the past few days with news and reports on stolen celebrity photos. Commentators, talking heads, bloggers, and tech "experts" have been finger pointing, blaming all parties, guilting, lambasting, analyzing, and profiting off these leaks with a mess of hasty, poorly reported information. This article is not about that.

The purpose of this piece is not to analyze what Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities did wrong nor analyze the privacy implications (though a future piece will look at these issues). Instead, we'll look at various attack vectors and how you can avoid them.

#General Security

Though no conclusive investigations have been completed, it seems more likely that this hack is actually a leak from many hacks utilizing many methods over a long period of time.

[Here](https://www.nikcub.com/posts/notes-on-the-celebrity-data-theft/) is an excellent piece analyzing these underground nude trading rings and how they operate.

Because of the varied attack vectors (some of which have only recently been [patched](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2014/09/01/this-could-be-the-apple-icloud-flaw-that-led-to-celebrity-photos-being-leaked/)) there is no silver bullet you can use to secure your data.

There is a strong possibility that some of these hacks originated not from the subject's phone but rather from someone else that the photos were shared with. This point is the biggest "gotcha" in sharing personal photos. You are ultimately at the mercy of his or her or their security as well - not even taking into account the trust that he/she/they will not willingly share your nudes. 

###Your Passwords Suck

Odds are your passwords are _terrible_. Odds are that you reuse the same password on tons of sites. Odds are that what you think you know about passwords is wrong. 

There is evidence that at least some of these hacks occurred because of weak passwords.

It's okay, there's a lot of bad information out there. Covering all aspects of passwords is well beyond the scope of this article, but lets touch on a few issues.

####Make it Random

The single best thing you can do for your password is to make it random. Unfortunately us humans are awful at making random passwords. Even when we follow the basic rules: 
* Avoid dictionary words - they take minutes to hack.
* Avoid wikipedia article names - they take minutes to hack. 
* Avoid "[leet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet)" speak (7h4+ 1$ C0mM0n l3773r @nD $ym8ol RepLaC3m3n7) - crackers have dictionaries that sub for that too.
* Include numbers and symbols - they've got tools for that too.

What can you do? Let software generate a password for you.

###Stop Using Security Questions


##The Abstinence Method

The only foolproof method when it comes to prevent leaks of your nude and racy photos is simply not to take them. Of course, this happening is as likely as abstinence only education working.

The problem with this method (though it is foolproof) is that it's ultimately about victim blaming and is the digital equivalent of "that outfit was just asking for it." Swapping sexual images is common in many relationships and should not be stigmatized, nor should those who have had their photos stolen be blamed for taking them.

##Snapchat

[Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/) is a company with a multi-billion dollar valuation built off millions of sexual and nude photos. The app took off on the concept of self-destructing messages that users seized for sending dirty photos quickly and easily without worries of the other party saving incriminating images.

Problem is that while Snapchat repeatedly insists they don't save images, they've been forced to [admit users can](http://blog.snapchat.com/post/88578064510/our-agreement-with-the-maryland-attorney-general). While there is the snapshot notification that the recipient has saved your image, there exist a number of tools and techniques for saving photos without notifying the other user.

In short, Snapchat does not guarantee the safety of your nudes. At best, you're limited to the
