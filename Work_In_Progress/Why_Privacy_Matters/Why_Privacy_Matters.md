#Why Privacy Matters

"I've got nothing to hide." It's the endless response to privacy concerns. "The government is illegally collecting and monitoring phone calls? Well, that's fine with me because _I have nothing to hide but the bad guys do._" We find this phrase in newspapers, repeated in interviews, plastered across speeches, filling blogs, and even trumpeted in advertising campaigns as the UK did in their Orwellian push for more CCTV - "_If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear._"

The problem with the "I've got nothing to hide" argument is that it fundamentally misunderstands privacy and what it means.

For those that use this defence, privacy is about hiding bad things. Their mind is filled with illegal and immoral images: someone withholding income from their taxes, a man cheating on his spouse, and of course terrorists plotting attacks against the United States. While privacy could cover these acts or pieces of information, ultimately privacy is about much more than hiding a wrong.

##Defining Privacy

At it's fundamental level, privacy is about control, specifically your control. Privacy is the control of your personal information, actions, and thoughts. Privacy is about whether you share this information, how much you share, and in what manner you share it.

##The Abuse of Privacy

 For the sake of simplicity, we can break privacy abuse down into four main areas:
* Collection
* Analysis
* Dissemination
* Action

Each area represents a unique and powerful invasion of privacy. The dangers these threats pose not only include emotional and potential physical damage, but also in "chilling behavior" which has profound societal ramifications.

The collection of information is the first step in privacy violation. Information can be gathered via surveillance (such as wiretapping or through a secondary method such as collecting bank records) or directly via coercion, interrogation, or unauthorized access (hacking, breaking and entering, etc). Whether from a state actor (NSA, etc) or a malicious third party, the collection of private information creates a cascade of potential damages.

Once information has been collected, the targets of the privacy invasion have immediately suffered a loss in personal freedom. They may be subject to the whims of the intercepting party who now has influence over them either through the threat or act of dissemination or by learning additional facts from the collected information. These are the second and third potential areas of privacy violations.

Analysis threatens individuals by potentially revealing additional information via _secondary analysis_. For example, if we simply have call, text, and email metadata information (that is not the content, just the recipent/sender, time sent, geo info, size, etc) between a man and a woman and that metadata reveals late calls and texts or late night meetings (from geo information) we can quickly assume they are engaging in a relationship - information that may be valuable if one or both were to have significant others. And all of this can be easily deduced from simple analysis on very basic metadata. In fact, General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and the CIA, has affirmed that the "[We kill people based on metadata.](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/may/10/we-kill-people-based-metadata/)"

The potential effects of dissemination are more obvious. The threat of release of private information is the concept of blackmail which can net bad actors ransoms and bribes, acts and favors, and any number of goods or actions. Alternatively, the release of private information can potentially destroy careers, relationships, businesses, academic work, etc.

Action is the final threat. This can encompass both the actions of the bad actor (utilizing information to intercept an exchange, release a product to market first, etc) or the violated party (such as changing behavior when information is taken or released, a party threatens them, etc).

It's important to reiterate that the private information that is taken does not have to be illegal or immoral. Many of these abuses can arise from benign information (a stalker with an address for an example).

If you'd like a more detailed analysis, Law professor and privacy expert Daniel J. Solove has created an exhaustive definition in [A Taxonomy of Privacy](https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume154/issue3/Solove154U.Pa.L.Rev.477%282006%29.pdf) (PDF). In future pieces, we'll look into specific examples.


##What We Can Do

Fortunately, there are a number of small and large actions we can take to help restore some privacy and set us back on track to restoring what the UN calls a natural right. We plan to cover as much of this as possible with detailed and simple explanations to make it simple to regain some of what has been lost. Some of the guiding principles:

* Encrypt everything.
* Switch to alternative apps, programs, hardware, OS's, and companies that do not track and record your data.
* Demand accountability for the revelations we've learned from leaked and other data.
* Create and maintain a privacy dialogue with our elected leaders.
* [Vote](http://registertovote.org/index.html) with privacy in mind as an important issue.
* Work to strengthen privacy legislation (as MIPSA has done for the healthcare industry).

##The Tipping Point

We're sitting at an interesting point in history. The open web and its related technology has had profound effects on nearly every asset of our lives. These effects will continue and grow into the foreseeable future. But for the first time the potential of that future is under attack both from corporations with threats of monopolies and dismantling net neutrality and from governments who wage a constant cyber war against each other, groups, corporations, and their own populations. 

The revelations from Edward Snowden and other leakers and whistleblowers have shown how vast this threat has grown. There has been no one moment where privacy has been dismantled. Instead, the collapse follows much the same pattern as the environment has over the past few decades. Lots of small events, decisions, laws, actions, and problems have added up to create a potential catastrophe. While we may be past the point of no return for the climate, there's still time to rescue and restore our rights to privacy.
