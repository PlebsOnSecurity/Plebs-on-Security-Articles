Traditionally, [GitHub](http://github.com) is designed for and used by programmers. The site is a web interface for the [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) revision control system. Git, designed by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) makes it simple to track, edit, update, review changes, revert changes, and generally manage code. We're applying those same tools to journalism.

##GitHub for Journalism

The tools git provides and the community and simple interaction GitHub offers have huge potential for open journalism. The technology and site make it simple for third party users to contribute to pieces, offer suggestions or edits, and even add their own material! The open license we use also gives people the ability to completely clone (fork) our work and build, add, edit, and work off of it for their own purposes.

There are a number of ways to [get involved with Plebs on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/):

####Issues

If you see an error or omission in an article you can (after registering a free GitHub account) create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Think of an issue like an email or comment. Normally they're used to track bugs, but for journalism we might use them to notify of spelling errors, wrong links, incorrect information, etc.

####Pull Requests

If you're feeling more adventurous and want to dig into GitHub, you can make a pull request! A pull request lets you submit content yourself. This content can fix problems (a "patch" for programmers but an edit or addition for us) or contribute entirely new work! If the editors and community like and approve of your edits and contributions, they can merge them into the main project (and eventually onto [Plebs](https://plebsonsecurity.com).

The process of making and submitting a pull request requires you to [fork](http://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository, create a [branch](http://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for your edits, make your edits and/or contributions, and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). A more detailed tutorial is beyond the scope of this readme, but _many_ tutorials are available via a quick google search.

##GitHub Clients

Git is intended to be used via the terminal, but fortunately for those who are hesitant to enter the command line, there are excellent graphical options:
* [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) (Vista, 7, & 8)
* [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) (OS X 10.8 or later)

Odds are that if you're on a linux box you'll be comfortable with [terminal utilities](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux).

##Markdown

Though a larger style guide is in the works, it is worth noting that both our GitHub content and the articles on Plebs are written entirely in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown is a simple set of prompts that make it simple to write text for the web without HTML (it even supports emoji :smirk:). It's the same system [Reddit](https://reddit.com) uses for their comments.

Once you get used to writing markdown, everything else seems slow! GitHub has a great [introduction to markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to get you started.
